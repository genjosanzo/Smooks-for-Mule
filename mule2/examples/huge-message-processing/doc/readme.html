  <h1>Smooks for Mule: huge message processing example</h1>

  <p>
    This example demonstrates how Smooks together with Smooks for Mule can be used to <b>split, enrich,
    transform and route</b> huge messages (GB size messages).<br />
    <br />
    Because of the complexity of this example, a detailed explanation of how it works is provided within this page.
    The Mule and Smooks configuration files are also thoroughly documented.
  </p>

  </ul>

  <a name="overview" ></a>
  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    In many uses cases, messages can contain data that is of interest to multiple parties.
    Each party can have different requirements, for instance a different data format or a different
    delivery method. A party could also require information which is related to the message
    but isn't in the message itself. It becomes even more complex when the source message is a huge (GB size) data stream.
    It the responsibility of the ESB to take care of these integration requirements.
  </p>
  <p>
    Extracting, enriching and distributing information from a message to multiple parties is not a trivial process.
    The information must first be extracted by splitting the huge message in it's parts.
    Then some outside data source, for instance a database or some services, must be queried for the information to
    enrich the source information. The new set of information must then be reassembled in the required format for every party.
  </p>
  <p>
    Smooks together with Smooks for Mule enables Mule to solve these issues in a powerful, performant and declaritive manner.
    Mule provides the transport layer for streaming in the huge message and to dispatch the splitted and enriched messages back
    to it's consumers. Smooks provides the capabilities to split, enrich and transform/generate the split messages, as well as trigger
    the routing of the split messages to their target endpoint. Smooks for Mule glues the two together.
  </p>
  <p>
    This example is based on the use case that the information of a set of products needs to be sent to multiple parties.
    The ESB receives the information from an EDI file stored on the file system. Each product contains it's base information
    (product id, name, brand, price etc), as well as a list of parts and a list of technical specifications.
  </p>
  <p>
    The following lists the consuming parties and there requirements:

    <ol>
      <li>The first party requires:
        <ul>
          <li>Must receive all the source product information</li>
          <li>Must be in XML</li>
          <li>Must be sent to a JMS queue</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>The second party requires:
        <ul>
          <li>Must receive specific fields of the base product information and the id's of every part</li>
          <li>Must be in JSON</li>
          <li>The product must have the category 'Complete Systems' or 'Laptops'</li>
          <li>Must be sent to a JMS queue</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>The third party requires:
        <ul>
          <li>Must receive specific fields of the base product information</li>
          <li>Must receive the parts id, name and brand <i>(note that the name and brand information is not available in the source message)</i></li>
          <li>The product information and it parts must be inserted into the EXT_PRODUCT and EXT_PARTS tables of an external database</li>
          <li>At least 20 products need to be in stock <i>(note that the stock information is not available in the source message)</i></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </p>

  <p>
    The main challenges are:

    <ul>
      <li>The second and third parties only want parts of the source message. This means that we are not dealing with a simple
      fragment extraction. We need to reconstruct the new messages from different parts of the source message.
      <li>Every message party requires there message in a different format: XML, JSON and JDBC</li>
      <li>The routed messages for the third party need to be enriched.<br/>An internal database is used to retrieve the necessary data.</li>
      <li>The second and third parties only receive there messages based on a condition.</li>
      <li>The third message requires information for the condition that is not within the source message.<br />A Mule Service can provided this information for us.</li>
    </ul>

  <a name="installation"></a>
  <h2>Installation</h2>
  <p>
    Make sure you have set the <b>MULE_HOME</b> environment variable
    and that you have installed the Smooks for Mule module itself.<br />
    <br />
    Run <b>&quot;ant install&quot;</b> from the root folder of this example.
  </p>

  <a name="runningTheExample"></a>
  <h2>Running the example</h2>
  <p>
    Make sure you have installed the example as describe in the previous section.
    <ul>
      <li>Open 5 command shell windows in the root folder of this example.</li>
      <li>In the first window, execute "ant run-services" to start the HSQLDB Database and JSM Server</li>
      <li>In the second window, execute 'run' shell script (Unix/Linux) or 'run.bat' batch file (Windows) to start Mule.<br>
        Alternatively, if you have added Mule to your executable path as recommended in INSTALL.txt, you can run the example from the command line as follows:
        <br />
          <b>Linux / Unix:</b> mule -config ./conf/mule-config.xml<br />
        <b>Windows: </b> mule.bat -config .\conf\mule-config.xml<br />
      </li>

      <li>In the third window, execute "ant run-consumer-1" to start the JMS consumer of the first party</li>
      <li>In the fourth window, execute "ant run-consumer-2" to start the JMS consumer of the second party</li>
      <li>In the fifth window, execute "ant generate" to start the message creation tool.</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Demonstration</h2>
  <p>
    For convenience I created a demonstration video that shows you how to run this example and what the example
    does when you run it.<br />

  <a name="howItWorks" ></a>
  <h2>How it works</h2>

  <p>
    In this section is explained how this example works. First we show how
    the input format looks like. Then we explain how Mule is configured. Finally
    we take a look at the most important part namely how Smooks is configured.<br>

    You don't need a lot of knowledge of Smooks to understand the explanation. It could
    however be a bit heavy if this is the first time that you see Smooks in action. Take a
    look at the <a href="http://milyn.codehaus.org/smooks">Smooks website</a> for more information
    on how to use Smooks.

    Take a good look at the comments within the configuration files. They explain for the biggest part
    what each component does and how they work.

  <h3>Import file</h3>
  <p>
    The import format we will be processing looks like this:

SPC|Height|6000mm
SPC|Width|6000mm
<i class="comment">... (more PRD, PRT and SPC segments. One PRD per product. One PRT segment per Product Part.
     One SPC segment per  Specification)</i></code></pre>

      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Mule configuration</h3>
    As can be seen from the <a href="process.jpg">process illustration</a> above, this example revolves around
    the "ProductProcessorService" Service deployment. This service defines the Smooks router, which executes Smooks to do all the processing,
    as follows:
    <pre><code>&lt;service name=&quot;ProductProcessorService&quot;&gt;
    &lt;inbound&gt;

        &lt;!--
          The inbound endpoint streams the EDI files from the ./data/in directory.
        --&gt;
        &lt;file:inbound-endpoint
          connector-ref=&quot;dataIn&quot;
          path=&quot;./data/in&quot;
          pollingFrequency=&quot;1000&quot;
          moveToDirectory=&quot;./data/out&quot;
          synchronous=&quot;true&quot; &gt;

          &lt;file:filename-wildcard-filter pattern=&quot;*.edi&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;/file:inbound-endpoint&gt;
    &lt;/inbound&gt;

    &lt;outbound&gt;

      &lt;!--
        Declares and configures the Smooks for Mule router.
        This router uses the /smooks/config.xml Smooks config file to process the EDI stream.
        The declared endpoints are referenced from within the Smooks config file to route the message parts
        too or to invoke the StockService with.

        Note: By declaring the config attribute 'reportPath' Smooks generates a report in which you can see
        how Smooks processes the EDI data. You should only enable it for small (1-10) data sets. Generating the
        report uses a lot of performance and with a big file it generates a huge report file.
      --&gt;
      &lt;smooks:router configFile=&quot;/smooks/config.xml&quot; honorSynchronicity=&quot;true&quot;&gt;
          &lt;vm:outbound-endpoint name=&quot;StockServiceEndpoint&quot; path=&quot;StockService&quot; synchronous=&quot;true&quot;/&gt;
          &lt;jms:outbound-endpoint name=&quot;ReceiveAllProductsEndpoint&quot; queue=&quot;example.AllProducts&quot; connector-ref=&quot;jmsConnector&quot;/&gt;
          &lt;jms:outbound-endpoint name=&quot;ReceivePCsAndLaptopsEndpoint&quot; queue=&quot;example.PCsAndLaptops&quot; connector-ref=&quot;jmsConnector&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;/smooks:router&gt;

    &lt;/outbound&gt;

&lt;/service&gt;</code></pre>
  In the requirements we need to route the products to two JMS clients and write some product records into the database.
  The JMS communication is handled via the two JMS outbound endpoints. The database routing is completely handled within Smooks.
  Later we will look in more detail at the Smooks configuration of this router .
  </p>
  <p>
    Another interresting service is the StockService. The Stock Service is used by the Product Processor Service to retrieve the stock of a product.
  In theory this Stock Service should look into some warehouse system to get this information.
  In this example however it only generates a random stock size and returns that as result.
  <pre><code>&lt;service name=&quot;StockService&quot;&gt;
  &lt;inbound&gt;
    &lt;vm:inbound-endpoint path=&quot;StockService&quot; synchronous=&quot;true&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;/inbound&gt;
  &lt;component class=&quot;example.hmp.mule.service.StockService&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/service&gt;</code></pre>
  </p>

  <h3>Smooks configuration</h3>

  <p>
    With the Smooks configuration you instruct Smooks how to process the incoming data.
    The configuration in this example is spread over several files. This keeps the configuration
    clear and clean.
  </p>
  <p>
    In a complex use case it can be difficult to see what is going on in Smooks.
    For this reason Smooks provides a HtmlReportGenerator class. It generates a HTML execution report
    file of Smooks it's processes. This visualizes those processes and help you understand what is going on.
    The generator is the nearest thing to a debugging tool that Smooks currently has.
    Within mule you can activate it by providing the 'reportPath' parameter in the Smooks router with a file location.
    Do not use it in a production environment because the generator takes a lot of performance.
    For this example we already generated a report which you can find <a href="execution-report.html">here</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
  The top level Smooks configuration is:

  <pre><code>&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;
&lt;!--
	This is the main Smooks configuration file. Here we set the general configuration
	properties and import all the smooks configuration parts.
 --&gt;
&lt;smooks-resource-list xmlns=&quot;http://www.milyn.org/xsd/smooks-1.1.xsd&quot;
  xmlns:core=&quot;http://www.milyn.org/xsd/smooks/smooks-core-1.3.xsd&quot;&gt;

  &lt;!--
    This part sets the global configuration parameters. In this
    case we only set that we want to use the SAX stream filter instead of
    the DOM stream filter. This is very important because the SAX filter is
    faster then the DOM filter and only the SAX filter can handle huge messages.
  --&gt;
  &lt;params&gt;
    &lt;param name=&quot;stream.filter.type&quot;&gt;SAX&lt;/param&gt;
  &lt;/params&gt;

  &lt;!--
    Imports the EDI reader configuration
  --&gt;
  &lt;import file=&quot;read/edi-product-reader.xml&quot; /&gt;

  &lt;!--
    Imports the database datasource configuration
  --&gt;
  &lt;import file=&quot;database/datasource.xml&quot; /&gt;

  &lt;!--
    Imports the javabean binding configuration
  --&gt;
  &lt;import file=&quot;binding/bean-binding.xml&quot; /&gt;

  &lt;!--
    The following two elements import the configuration which enrich the data from
	the EDI message.
  --&gt;
  &lt;import file=&quot;enrich/stock-service.xml&quot; /&gt;

  &lt;import file=&quot;enrich/part-data.xml&quot; /&gt;

  &lt;!--
    The following three elements import the router configurations to several
    end points.
    Because these routers all do there thing on the visit after action they must
    be defined before the javabean binding and enriching configuration
    if these actions are to be executed after the javabean binding and enriching.
  --&gt;
  &lt;import file=&quot;routing/route-to-database.xml&quot; /&gt;

  &lt;import file=&quot;routing/route-to-jms-all-receiver.xml&quot; /&gt;

  &lt;import file=&quot;routing/route-to-jms-pc-and-laptop-receiver.xml&quot; /&gt;

&lt;/smooks-resource-list&gt;</code></pre>

    In the following sections we explain each imported file. The sections are in the order as defined in this file,
    except for the routing configuration files which we will attend to at then end. It is easier to understand those sections
    if you first know where the data, that they route, comes from.	Remember however that the order in which we defined the imports
    in the main configuration file is very important. As explained before, this is because the order in which the resources execute
    depends on the order in which they appear in the resource configuration, with the visitBefore events firing "first-to-last"
    and the visitAfter events firing "last-to-first".
  </p>

  <h4>read/edi-product-reader.xml</h4>

  <p>
    This Smooks resource configuration file defines only the EDI Parser.

    <pre><code>&lt;!--
  This resource configuration configures the EDI Parser to parse the
  message stream into a stream of SAX events.

  The &quot;mapping-model&quot; parameter defines the EDI to SAX Event mapping model configuration for the parser.
--&gt;
&lt;edi:reader mappingModel=&quot;/smooks/read/edi-to-xml-product-mapping.xml&quot; /&gt;</code></pre>

  After configuring this resource and turning on the Smooks Execution Report we can see the message
  event stream as produced by the EDI Parser:<br/>

  <img src="inc/ser-event-stream.png" class="screenshot">
  </p>

  <h4>database/datasource.xml</h4>

  <p>
    This configuration prepares the database datasources for the internal and the external databases. The internal
    database is used to retrieve information about the product parts which are not in the source data. In the external database
    we insert the product and part records, as required by the requirements of the third party (see the <a href="#overview" >overview</a> section).

    <pre><code>&lt;!--
  Configure the Datasource for the 'internal' database.
  In this example we only read from this database to demonstrate
  the data enriching in Smooks.
--&gt;
&lt;ds:direct bindOnElement=&quot;$document&quot;
               datasource=&quot;InternalPartsDatabase&quot;
               driver=&quot;org.hsqldb.jdbcDriver&quot;
               url=&quot;jdbc:hsqldb:hsql://localhost:9992/milyn-hsql-9992&quot;
               username=&quot;sa&quot;
               password=&quot;&quot;
               autoCommit=&quot;false&quot; /&gt;

&lt;!--
  Configure the Datasource for the 'external' database.
  In this example we write to this database to demonstrate
  the database routing in Smooks.
--&gt;
&lt;ds:direct bindOnElement=&quot;$document&quot;
               datasource=&quot;ExternalDatabase&quot;
               driver=&quot;org.hsqldb.jdbcDriver&quot;
               url=&quot;jdbc:hsqldb:hsql://localhost:9992/milyn-hsql-9992&quot;
               username=&quot;sa&quot;
               password=&quot;&quot;
               autoCommit=&quot;false&quot; /&gt;</code></pre>

    These Datasources are bound to the Smooks ExecutionContext at the start of message processing
    via the selector parameter (the '$document' value selects the message root/document event).
    Any JDBC Connection created for the ExecutionContext is committed/rolledback and cleaned up at the end of the
    message processing. Note that it is also possible to use a container provided JNDI datasource by setting the 'datasource' parameter to 'JndiDataSource'.<br />
    <br/>
    In the execution report we can see that the datasources are bound on the 'visitBefore' event of the root 'product' element.<br/>

    <img src="inc/ser-datasource-visitBefore.png" class="screenshot">

    <br/>On the 'visitAfter' event we can see that the datasources are cleaned up:<br/>

    <img src="inc/ser-datasource-visitAfter.png" class="screenshot">

  </p>

  <h4>enrich/stock-service.xml</h4>

  <p>

    The "enrich/stock-service.xml" resource file contains a Mule Dispatcher resource for calling the StockService to retrieve the stock information.

    <pre><code>&lt;!--
  This Mule dispatcher calls the Stock Service endpoint synchronously on every product.
  Specifically it executes on the 'visitAfter' event. By then the product id is set in the Product object.
  The Stock Service endpoint uses the product id to see what it's current stock is (in this
  example it generates a random number).
  The result returned by the service is added to the bean map under the beanId 'productStock'.
--&gt;
&lt;mule:dispatcher endpointName=&quot;StockServiceEndpoint&quot; resultBeanId=&quot;productStock&quot; dispatchOnElement=&quot;product/id&quot;&gt;
  &lt;mule:messagePayload&gt;
    &lt;mule:expression&gt;product.id&lt;/mule:expression&gt;
  &lt;/mule:messagePayload&gt;
&lt;/mule:dispatcher&gt;</code></pre>

  The data returned by StockService is bound into the bean context and so is available to other resources executing under the
  same ExecutionContext e.g. templating resources, BeanPopulator resources etc.

  <h4>enrich/part-data.xml</h4>

  <p>
    This resource configuration file configures a resource for reading reference/enhancement data from the database.

    <pre><code>&lt;!--
  This SQLExecute resource configuration executes for every product part. It
  uses the product id from the Product object to execute a query on the internal database.
  The result set is added to the bean map under the beanId 'partDetails'.
--&gt;
&lt;db:executor executeOnElement=&quot;product/part&quot; datasource=&quot;InternalPartsDatabase&quot;&gt;
    &lt;db:statement&gt;select name, brand from int_part where id = ${part.id}&lt;/db:statement&gt;
    &lt;db:resultSet name=&quot;partDetails&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/db:executor&gt;</code></pre>

  The result set created by the resource above is a list of 'record' maps. Even if there was only one record in the result, you
  must use the 'partDetails[0]' syntax (within the templates or scripts) to access that one record.
  </p>

  <h4>binding/bean-binding.xml</h4>

  <p>
    At the core of nearly all Smooks based message processing, is the concept of "binding" data from the Source message event
    stream into memory (into the bean context). Once the data is bound into memory in a Physical or Virtual Object Model, it can
    be used by other Smooks resources such as the template resources, routing resources, bean populator resources, resource conditions
    and of course custom Smooks visitor implementations. The populated Object Model may itself be the Result output by the Smooks.filter operation.
    Basically, the data binding functionality provided by the Javabean Cartridge is a very fundamental part of practically all
    Smooks based filtering operations. Without it, you are quite limited in what you can do.

    The following configuration file configures the bindings:

    <pre><code>&lt;!--
  This defines the binding of the product data from the EDI document to the Product object. It
  also binds the parts and specs ArrayList to there properties. These two get configured in the next
  resource configurations.
--&gt;
&lt;jb:bindings beanId=&quot;product&quot; createOnElement=&quot;product&quot; class=&quot;example.hmp.model.Product&quot; &gt;
  &lt;jb:value property=&quot;id&quot; data=&quot;product/id&quot; decoder=&quot;Long&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;jb:value property=&quot;name&quot; data=&quot;product/name&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;jb:value property=&quot;brand&quot; data=&quot;product/brand&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;jb:value property=&quot;category&quot; data=&quot;product/category&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;jb:value property=&quot;price&quot; data=&quot;product/price&quot; decoder=&quot;BigDecimal&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;jb:value property=&quot;tax&quot; data=&quot;product/tax&quot; decoder=&quot;Integer&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;jb:value property=&quot;guarantee&quot; data=&quot;product/guarantee&quot;/&gt;

  &lt;jb:wiring property=&quot;parts&quot; beanIdRef=&quot;parts&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;jb:wiring property=&quot;specs&quot; beanIdRef=&quot;specs&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/jb:bindings&gt;


&lt;!--
  This defines that a ArrayList is created for every product
  and that it adds all the Part objects to the array.
--&gt;
&lt;jb:bindings beanId=&quot;parts&quot; createOnElement=&quot;product&quot; class=&quot;java.util.ArrayList&quot; &gt;
  &lt;jb:wiring beanIdRef=&quot;part&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/jb:bindings&gt;

&lt;!--
  This defines the binding of the part data from the EDI document to the Part object.
--&gt;
&lt;jb:bindings beanId=&quot;part&quot; createOnElement=&quot;product/part&quot; class=&quot;example.hmp.model.Part&quot; &gt;
  &lt;jb:value property=&quot;id&quot; data=&quot;part/id&quot; decoder=&quot;Long&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;jb:value property=&quot;quantity&quot; data=&quot;part/quantity&quot; decoder=&quot;Integer&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;jb:value property=&quot;buildIn&quot; data=&quot;part/build-in&quot; decoder=&quot;Boolean&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/jb:bindings&gt;

&lt;!--
  This defines that a ArrayList is created for every product
  and that it adds all the Spec objects to the array.
--&gt;
&lt;jb:bindings beanId=&quot;specs&quot; createOnElement=&quot;product&quot; class=&quot;java.util.ArrayList&quot; &gt;
  &lt;jb:wiring beanIdRef=&quot;spec&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/jb:bindings&gt;

&lt;!--
  This defines the binding of the specs data from the EDI document to the Spec object.
--&gt;
&lt;jb:bindings beanId=&quot;spec&quot; createOnElement=&quot;product/spec&quot; class=&quot;example.hmp.model.Spec&quot; &gt;
  &lt;jb:value property=&quot;name&quot; data=&quot;spec/name&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;jb:value property=&quot;value&quot; data=&quot;spec/value&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/jb:bindings&gt;</code></pre>

  Once this data is bound into the bean context (under the beanIds of "product", "parts", "part", "specs" and "spec"),
  it is available to all other resources executing under the same Smooks ExecutionContext. The key to
  processing huge messages is the fact that we can keep the memory footprint associated with the ExecutionContext
  to a minimum. We do this by only maintaining the current Product in memory at at any one time i.e. we don't
  accumulate a list of the Products. This also means that we need to be able to use the Product data
  (for splitting, routing etc) while we have it in memory and before we throw it away in place of the next Product
  in the message event stream. In other words, we can't wait for the whole message to be processed before processing
  the Product data; everything is done while we are processing the message event stream i.e. binding, templating/transforming, routing etc.
  We do this by targeting these other resources at the same events in the message event stream i.e. the &lt;product&gt; events.

  </p>

  <h4>routing/route-to-database.xml</h4>

  <p>
    This resource configuration defines the routing of the product data to the External Database.

    <pre><code>&lt;!--
  Here we define a global condition. Resource later refer to this condition by it's id.

  This condition is a two parter. The first part is the business rule which defines
  that only products with a stock higher then 100 are added to the database. The productStock
  bean comes from a Mule dispatcher that calls the Stock Service, defined in the
  conf/smooks/enrich/stock-service.xml file.
  The second part is 	only there because this is an example. We use it to prevent flooding of
  the database with thousands of product and part records. The productCount bean is set
  in the next db:executor resource.
--&gt;
&lt;conditions&gt;
  &lt;condition id=&quot;minProductStock&quot;&gt;&lt;!-- productStock &gt; 100 &amp;&amp; productCount[0].numberProducts &lt; 100  --&gt;&lt;/condition&gt;
&lt;/conditions&gt;

&lt;!--
  This SQL executor configuration executes a query that counts the number
  of products in the external database. It is only here for the example.
  The global condition 'minProductStock' uses it to stop the inserting into
  the database when 99 products are inserted.
--&gt;
&lt;db:executor executeOnElement=&quot;product&quot; datasource=&quot;ExternalDatabase&quot; executeBefore=&quot;true&quot;&gt;
    &lt;db:statement&gt;select count(*) as &quot;numberProducts&quot; from EXT_PRODUCT&lt;/db:statement&gt;
    &lt;db:resultSet name=&quot;productCount&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/db:executor&gt;

&lt;!--
  This SQL executor resource configuration executes an INSERT statement with all the necessary
  product data on the external database. The statement executes on the after visit phase of the
  guarantee element.

  Maybe you wonder why we don't set it on the product element itself. This is
  because the insert statement would be executed after the insert statements of the part
  elements (those inserts are configured in the next resource-config block). That would cause
  referential exceptions when a part gets inserted when the product insn't inserted yet. Because
  we know that we got all the data on the after visit of the 'guarantee' element and because of the
  nature of the EDI parser the 'guarantee' element is always there, we can safely execute the
  insert at that moment.

  The condition elements refers to the global 'minProductStock' condition.
--&gt;
&lt;db:executor executeOnElement=&quot;product/guarantee&quot; datasource=&quot;ExternalDatabase&quot;&gt;
    &lt;condition idRef=&quot;minProductStock&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;db:statement&gt;insert into EXT_PRODUCT values(${product.id}, ${product.name}, ${product.brand}, ${product.category}, ${product.price}, ${product.tax}, now())&lt;/db:statement&gt;
&lt;/db:executor&gt;

&lt;!--
  This SQLExecutor resource configuration executes an INSERT statement with all the necessary
  part data on the external database. The statement executes on the after visit phase of the
  part element.

  We use the same resource condition as the previous sql executor for the same reasons.
--&gt;
&lt;db:executor executeOnElement=&quot;product/part&quot; datasource=&quot;ExternalDatabase&quot;&gt;
    &lt;condition idRef=&quot;minProductStock&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;db:statement&gt;insert into EXT_PART values(${part.id}, ${product.id}, ${partDetails[0].NAME}, ${partDetails[0].BRAND})&lt;/db:statement&gt;
&lt;/db:executor&gt;</code></pre>

  You should note that in this case the condition is based on the data retrieved from the Stock service.
  The 'productStock' bean from the bean context contains the stock size. You can also see that we
    use the enriched Part data (the variables <b>${partDetails[0].NAME}</b> and <b>${partDetails[0].BRAND}</b>) in the insert query.
  </p>

  <h4>routing/route-to-jms-all-receiver.xml</h4>

  <p>
  This resource configuration file defines the routing resources for the "jms-all-receiver" client.


  <pre><code>&lt;!--
  This FreeMarker template resource configuration generates the XML
  at the end of every product. It binds the XML String in the bean map under
  bean ID 'XML_ReceiveAllProducts'.

  This Mule dispatcher resource configuration executes at the end of every product.
  It dispatches the product XML to the 'ReceiveAllProductsEndpoint' endpoint.
  The XML is retrieved from the 'XML_ReceiveAllProducts' String from the bean Map.

</code></pre>

  The first resource generates the XML message by applying a FreeMarker template. The FreeMarker template receives it's data from the beans
  within the bean context. This is the most straight forward transformation. We don't use any conditionals or enrich the new message by using data
  from other resources then the source message itself.
  The second resource listed simply dispatches the XML (generated by the first resource) to the "ReceiveAllProductsEndpoint" endpoint.
  </p>

  <h4>routing/route-to-jms-pc-and-laptop-receiver.xml</h4>

  <p>
    The following configuration looks much like the previous "routing/route-to-jms-all-receiver.xml" configuration. The biggest difference
    are the resource conditions. These conditions are used so that the messages are
    only generated and dispatched to the client when the condition is met.

    <pre><code>&lt;conditions&gt;
  &lt;!--
    This condition checks that a product is defined and that it is in the correct category.
   --&gt;
  &lt;condition id=&quot;productInCertainCategories&quot;&gt;
    &lt;!-- VARS.isdef(&quot;product&quot;) &amp;&amp; product != null &amp;&amp; (product.category == &quot;Complete Systems&quot; || product.category == &quot;Laptops&quot;) --&gt;

&lt;/conditions&gt;

&lt;!--
      This FreeMarker template resource configuration generates the JSON
      at the end of every product. It binds the JSON String in the bean map under
      bean ID 'JSON_ReceivePCsAndLaptops'.

      &quot;Complete Systems&quot; or &quot;Laptops&quot;.
