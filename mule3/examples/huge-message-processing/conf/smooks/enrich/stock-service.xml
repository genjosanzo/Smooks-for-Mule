	<!--
		This Mule dispatcher calls the Stock Service endpoint synchronously on every product.
		Specifically it executes on the 'visitAfter' event. By then the product id is set in the Product object.
		The Stock Service endpoint uses the product id to see what it's current stock is (in this
		example it generates a random number).
		The result returned by the service is added to the bean map under the beanId 'productStock'.
